## Popularity of Programming Languages

### The Dataset

How can we tell what programming languages are currently most widely used, as well as which languages seem to be growing in popularity or fading over time? One source of data is the programming question-and-answer site Stack Overflow. Each question has a tag or tags that describe its topic(s) and are searchable by users. For example, there is a tag for languages like `R` or Python, as well as for packages like `ggplot2` or `pandas`. By analyzing data on the number of questions tagged for a language, we can get some sense of how many people might be using it. Individuals can access data about Stack Overflow from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer. The rows of the dataset contain frequency counts for individual question tags by year across several years (2008--2018), as well as the total count of all tags for the given year. 

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("tags.png")
```

A Look at the Data

```{r}
by_tag_year <- read_csv("by_tag_year.csv")
by_tag_year
```

### Most Common Question Tags

```{r}
top_25_tags <- by_tag_year %>%
  group_by(tag) %>%
  summarize(tag_total = sum(number),
            years_total = sum(year_total),
            fraction = tag_total / years_total) %>%
  arrange(desc(tag_total)) %>% 
  head(n = 25)

ggplot(top_25_tags, aes(x = reorder(tag, fraction), y = fraction)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = .5, color = "darkgray", fill = "#7570B3") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, .15, .01)) +
  labs(title = "Overall Top 25 Question Tags on Stack Overflow for Years 2008-2018",
       subtitle = "Note: There were a total of 4080 distinct question tags used during this 11-year period.",
       x = "question tag",
       y = "relative frequency of tag as a fraction of all tags for the observed period") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
highest_tags <- head(top_25_tags$tag, n = 6)

by_tag_top_5 <- by_tag_year %>% 
  filter(tag %in% highest_tags) %>% 
  mutate(fraction = number / year_total)

ggplot(by_tag_top_5, aes(x = year, y = fraction, fill = tag)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = .5, color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2008:2018) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, .15, .02)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  facet_wrap( ~ tag) +
  labs(title = "Overall Top 6 Question Tags on Stack Overflow for Years 2008-2018",
       subtitle = "Yearly fractions for the six tags that were found to have the largest overall frequencies",
       x = "year",
       y = "fraction of all tags for a given year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none")
```

### Tags for `R`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2`

How has the occurrence of the `R` tag and the two most common `tidyverse` packages changed over time? Can we model this increase using regression analysis?

```{r}
by_tag_year_rdg <- by_tag_year %>% 
  filter(tag %in% c("r", "dplyr", "ggplot2")) %>% 
  mutate(percent = 100 * number / year_total) 
```

```{r}
ggplot(by_tag_year_rdg, aes(x = year, y = percent, color = tag)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2008:2018) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.25, 3), label = unit_format(unit = "%", digits = 2)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(title = "Questions on Stack Overflow with R, dplyr, or ggplot2 Tags",
       y = "percent of all tags in a given year") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
by_tag_year_r <- by_tag_year %>% 
  filter(tag  == "r") %>% 
  mutate(percent = 100 * number / year_total) 
```

Linear Regression Model for `R` Tag Only

```{r}
growthr <- lm(percent ~ year, data = by_tag_year_r)
summary(growthr)
```

Predictions for Years 2020 and 2030

```{r}
get_regression_points(growthr, newdata = data.frame(year = c(2020, 2030)), print = TRUE)
```
