### Answer the following questions your own...

#### **Identifying the Problem**

Based on the analysis of annual mortality data from 1841-1846, do you think Dr. Semmelweis was right to believe that there was a problem in Clinic 1 versus Clinic 2? Was lack of handwashing a reasonable theory? Support your answer using specific information from the problem description and analysis.

#### **Semmelweis's Intervention**

Does the analysis of monthly mortality data from before and after Semmelweis's intervention generally support his theory? Could the outcomes we observe after handwashing was started be a just coincidence (i.e., random)? Support your answer using specific information from the problem description and analysis.
