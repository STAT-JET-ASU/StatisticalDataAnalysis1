#     I will use Star Wars terminology as a metaphor when scoring your engagement activities. A Padawan is training to one day become a Jedi. Jedi Knight is a rank within the Jedi Order, referring to students who complete their initial training and pass the Jedi Trials to become full members, while a Jedi Master has demonstrated exceptional achievement beyond the skills of a Jedi Knight. Despite their advanced levels, Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters still have many things to learn and they may make mistakes. Both Jedi Knight and Jedi Master ratings earn a checkmark, but for some activities this distinction will help to differentiate your degree of proficiency and provide formative assessment. Remember that earning a checkmark does not necessarily mean that all your work was error-free. You will need to review solutions and/or instructor feedback for each assignment to additionally clarify and solidify the material.
