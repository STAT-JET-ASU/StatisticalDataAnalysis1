#### **Description & Objectives**

##### ***Catalogue Description***

STT3850 Statistical Data Analysis 1 provides an overview of modern statistical data analysis. Programming with data, including simulations and bootstrapping, will be an integral part of the course. Techniques for parsing univariate and multivariate data sets will be examined. Coverage of probability, random variables, standard probability distributions and statistical sampling distributions will be sufficient to prepare the student for statistical inference. Inferential topics will include parameter estimation, hypothesis testing for means and proportions, goodness of fit tests, and tests for independence. Standard and computationally intensive regression techniques may also be covered.

##### ***Learning Objectives***

* DATA AND SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS: Demonstrate understanding and be able to explain properties of frequency, shape, center, spread, and outliers in the context of observed data; be able to appropriately summarize and visualize data; be able to calculate, simulate, and summarize sampling distributions for commonly used statistics such as means and proportions; understand the properties of the normal distribution and be able to assess data for normality.

* STRENGTH OF STATISTICAL EVIDENCE: Be able to explain the logic and construction of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, including the meaning of p-values; be able to perform selected asymptotic, resampling, and bootstrap inference procedures and interpret results in the context of the data; fit and interpret selected correlation measures and linear models; be able to discuss and verify the assumptions of any modeling and inferential procedures used.

* COMPARE AND CONNECT: Compare analytical/theoretical results with resampling/bootstrapping results to connect the different modes of exploration; analyze data sets in different ways depending on the research question(s).

* STATISTICAL COMPUTING: Effectively and efficiently implement and report statistical calculations, procedures, and visualizations using R and R Markdown, incorporating some of the principles of reproducible research.

* STATISTICS—THE BIG PICTURE: Demonstrate understanding of why statistical analysis and visualization is important to you, to people in your field of study, to people in other disciplines, and the larger world.

#### **Communication & Coursework**

##### ***AsULearn Forums***  

I will use the Course Announcements forum on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) to send out announcements and course information. You are responsible for knowing the content of all postings, in addition to anything I say in class. Except for extreme emergencies, all written communication must be handled through your **Private Forum** on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/). I prefer this method because it stores all exchanges in a place where we can easily access them and it keeps my class communications separate from the rest of my email. Monday through Friday, I will check forums for messages at least once per day between 10am and 6pm. I typically will check at least once on Saturdays. Do not expect replies on Sundays. In addition to private forums, I will create a **Class Forum** where students can ask their peers for help.

##### ***Learning Assessments***

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes statistical software. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using real data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and assessments have been structured with these principles in mind. It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must "speak the language" (statistics and R) to effectively demonstrate that you are achieving course objectives. We will be using both *formative* and *summative* assessments in this course. Formative assessments help both you and me check on your engagement and progress; for example, hands-on activities, questions during class, and online discussions. Summative assessments evaluate what you have learned learned throughout a course and how prepared you are to engage in the next level of study. 

**ASSESSMENTS**

* Effective Class Engagement (30%) --- Several different kinds of activities fall under this heading, including but not limited to hands-on labs, online discussions, surveys, and reflections. The [CBMS](https://www.cbmsweb.org/) statement “Active Learning in Post-Secondary Mathematics Education” emphasizes “classroom practices that engage students in activities, such as reading, writing, discussion, or problem solving, that promote higher-order thinking.” I will mark engagement activities to reward a good faith effort rather than for accuracy and indicate completion via a checkmark that will appear on the main page of AsULearn. Your engagement grade will be the percentage of checkmarks you earn in scored activities (those with dashed completion boxes). You can self-mark some other activities as complete, such as readings and videos. These have solid boxes and do not count toward your final grade. To accommodate emergencies, I will drop the lowest 3 scored engagement assignments. No late engagement assignments will be accepted.

    I will use Star Wars terminology as a metaphor when scoring your engagement activities. Padawans are training to one day become a Jedi. Jedi Knight is a rank within the Jedi Order, referring to Jedi who complete their training and pass the Jedi Trials to become full members. A Jedi Master has demonstrated exceptional achievement. Yet, despite their advanced levels, both Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters still have things to learn and may make mistakes. With respect to engagement, both Jedi and Jedi Master ratings earn a checkmark. Remember that earning a checkmark does not necessarily mean that all your work was error-free. You will need to review the solutions and/or instructor feedback for each assignment to clarify and solidify the material.

* DataCamp Courses (30%) --- You will complete several DataCamp courses that introduce statistics concepts and `R` programming skills in an interactive environment that allows you to repeat your attempts until you get the answers correct. Each exercise is worth a certain amount of XP toward the course total. If you make a mistake, basic hints are provided for free. You can get additional hints or even solutions at the cost of some XP. If you earn 80% or more of the XP for a course, your grade will be 100%. If you earn less than 80% of the XP, your grade will be the percentage earned. A penalty of 10% per day will be deducted for late completion.

* Written Exams (30%) --- You will complete two exams in this course. Each exam will include two parts: (1) a take-home portion that assesses hands-on statistical data analysis and computing, including interpretation of results; and (2) an in-class portion that addresses conceptual and/or theoretical knowledge. These exams are primarily summative assessments. However, to encourage the idea of exams as a formative experiences, to accommodate emergencies, and to help you solidify your knowledge, you will be allowed to turn in revisions on one exam that will replace the original grade. Otherwise, no late exams or exam make-ups will be allowed.

* Project (10%) --- The purpose of the project is to tie together concepts across the course. More information will be provided in a separate document. You will communicate your expertise in an R Markdown writeup and poster presentation session during the final exam period. This is a summative assessment. You must participate in the final project to pass the class. No late projects will be accepted.

##### ***Course Grading Scale***

This course will use the standard 10-point +/- grading scale (93--100 = A, 90--92 = A--, 87--89 = B+, etc.) to determine final grades. I do not round up. Accommodations *may* be made for documented extenuating circumstances that prevent you from completing work early/on time. Grades will be kept on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/). You should monitor your grades throughout the term to make sure they are complete and accurate. 


##### ***Inclement Weather***

If the university cancels classes, refer to [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) for alternate class assignments, which may include (but are not limited to) additional readings, videos, problems, and/or online discussions. All assignment due dates will remain in effect. Course accommodations for power outages and other weather-related issues will be made at the discretion of the instructor. Class cancelations for instructor emergencies or illness will be handled in a similar manner via AsuLearn.

#### **General Expectations**  

##### ***Engage with the Content***

Appalachian students are expected to make engagement with courses their first priority. Be proactive and take charge of your own learning! If you have not read/watched assigned materials or attempted problems and online programming modules before coming to class or office hours, you likely will be confused, feel lost, and have a terrible experience in this course. I DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN! Each of you has the capability to succeed. However, sometimes we must change certain behaviors, study habits, and/or emotional reactions. In this course, you will be challenged with concepts and problems you have never seen before. I do not expect you to be able to understand them all immediately. A critical first step in learning new material is seeing what you can do on your own. This may feel uncomfortable and frustrating. Success in statistics is not determined by whether it "comes naturally" to you or whether a topic seems “clear” the first time you are introduced to it. Instead, success is about learning to use mistakes and material we may be struggling with in order to grow. You will see that even I struggle at times; there is always something new to learn, especially when it comes to statistical computing in R. Each time we get stuck, it teaches us something about the problem we are working on and leads us to develop greater skill and better understanding of the content. 

##### ***Communicate with Others***

Knowing what you can do on your own is important, but in the real world, people are not generally expected to work alone. In fact, teamwork is frequently required to achieve good outcomes. You will be expected to share with your peers to help develop your own and their proficiencies. I encourage you to talk to me and to your classmates in person or electronically even when you are not specifically assigned by me to do so. Asking questions and explaining things to others is one of the best ways to improve your understanding. Together we will create an environment in which everyone is respectful to one another and feels comfortable asking questions, making mistakes, and offering good guesses. Explore concepts and write out your thinking in a way that can be shared with others. Try everything that is asked of you, even if only to say, “I do not understand such and such” or “I am stuck here.” Be as specific as possible. *Consider. Conjecture*. I will try to give you hints and direction to help you understand. At times though, to encourage the exploration process, I may direct you to rethink a problem and then come back to discuss it with me  afterwards. This occurs when I believe that the struggle to understand is imperative for your deep understanding.  

##### ***Invest Appropriate Time***

As per the University-wide Statement on Student Engagement with Courses (see University Policies below), you should expect to spend 2-3 hours on course work outside class for every hour you spend in class. STT 3850 is a 4-credit course, which means that course work and assessments are structured around 4 hours of class attendance and 8-12 hours of outside work per week. If you find that you are spending fewer hours than these guidelines suggest, you can probably improve your understanding and grade by studying more. If you are consistently spending more hours than these guidelines suggest, you may be studying inefficiently; in that case, you should come see me. Many students work during the school year to finance their educations; however, that does not change the requirements of this (or any) course. Budget your time accordingly and pace yourself to maximize your learning and achievement. 

##### ***Get Yourself "Unstuck"***

It is typically easier to answer well-constructed questions than questions that are less specific, especially when it comes to statistical computing. The Stack Overflow thread [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610) discusses how to construct a question that helps someone else reproduce the issue about which you are seeking help. [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen offers another useful perspective, which has been adapted in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3). Use instructor-provided resources, google for relevant solutions, seek help from your classmates, go to the [Math Tutoring Lab](https://mathsci.appstate.edu/academics/math-tutoring), and/or come in to [office hours](https://jillthomley.github.io/schedule.html). While I can sometimes help via Private Forum message, face-to-face is typically best.

#### **Additional Policies**

Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and who believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact the Dean of Students, 324 Plemmons Student Union, for a list of resources and support. The ASU Food Pantry and Free Store, which is located in the Office of Sustainability on the bottom floor of East Hall,  is a free resource with pantry and personal care items. See the **ASU Student Services** link on our [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) page for more resources and a statement regarding the confidentiality (or not) of personal information you may choose to share with me.

This course conforms with all Appalachian State University policies with respect to academic integrity, disability services, and class attendance. The details of these policies may be found at <http://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi>.

As stated in the ASU Undergraduate Bulletin, students are expected to attend all course meetings and are completely responsible for their own attendance. Any student who is absent for any reason is completely responsible for all material covered in class.

Our face to face time is limited, so it is important that your attention is not divided. There are some additional rules to help facilitate the face-to-face learning experience for both you and your peers:

* No food and drink in class. This is a rule for all computer labs in Walker Hall.
* Be ready to participate when class starts (e.g., notebooks and materials out).
* Do not pack up at the end of class until I am finished teaching and dismiss you.
* Photos, video, or audio recordings may not be taken in class without prior permission.
* Phones must be put away during class. If I see you using your phone, I may ask you to leave.
* Do not check email, surf the web, or do other coursework during class. I may ask you to leave.
* You are not allowed to use tobacco (including dip) or e-cigarettes in class. I _will_ ask you to leave.

This class is to be a welcoming environment where everyone can learn and explore. I want you to be sensitive and respectful to each other in all interactions, regardless of gender, political party, race, religion, sexuality, disability, etc. Activities that distract/disrupt your fellow students or the instructor may result in a lowered grade. First offenses typically will be dealt with by the instructor. Subsequent or serious behavior issues will be referred to the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentconduct.appstate.edu/).
