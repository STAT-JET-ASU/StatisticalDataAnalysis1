I will use the Course Announcements forum on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) to send out announcements and course information. You are responsible for knowing the content of all postings in addition to anything I say in class. Except for emergencies, all written communication should be handled through your Private Forum on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/). I prefer this method because it stores all exchanges in a place where we can easily access them and it keeps my class communications separate from the rest of my email.


**Course Description**  

STT3850 Statistical Data Analysis 1 provides an overview of modern statistical data analysis. Programming with data, including simulations and bootstrapping, will be an integral part of the course. Techniques for parsing univariate and multivariate data sets will be examined. Coverage of probability, random variables, standard probability distributions and statistical sampling distributions will be sufficient to prepare the student for statistical inference. Inferential topics will include parameter estimation, hypothesis testing for proportions, means and medians, goodness of fit tests, and tests for independence. Standard and computationally intensive regression techniques may also be covered.


**Course Objectives**

* PROBABILITY: Understand and explain basic theoretical properties of discrete and continuous probability models, such as expected value and variance; solve applied problems using one or more probability models.

* DISTRIBUTIONS: Understand and explain the properties of frequency, shape, center, spread, and outliers in the context of observed data; be able to appropriately summarize and visualize data; be able to calculate simulate and summarize sampling distributions for commonly used statistics such as means and proportions.

* STRENGTH OF STATISTICAL EVIDENCE: Understand the logic and construction of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, including the meaning of p-values; be able to perform appropriate resampling and bootstrapping inference procedures and interpret the results in the context of the original problem.

* COMPARE AND CONNECT: Compare analytical/theoretical results with resampling/bootstrapping results to connect the different modes of exploration; analyze data sets in different ways depending on the research question(s).

* STATISTICAL COMPUTING: Effectively and efficiently implement and report statistical calculations, procedures, and visualizations in R.

* STATISTICSâ€”THE BIG PICTURE: Understand why statistical data analysis and visualization is important to you, to people in your field of study, to people in other disciplines, and the larger world around us; become acquainted with the ethics of data collection.

**Course Assessment & Grading**

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes statistical software. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using real data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and assessments have been structured with these principles in mind. It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must "speak the language" (statistics and R) to effectively demonstrate your knowledge.

* DataCamp/Feedback: 20%
* Class Activities: 10%
* Video Lessons: 10%
* Exam 1: 20%
* Exam 2: 20% 
* Exam 3: 20%

This course uses the standard 10-point +/- grading scale (93--100 = A, 90--92 = A--, 87--89 = B+, etc.). All grades will be kept on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/). You should monitor your grades throughout the term to make sure they appear to be correct and complete. Feel free to inquire about your grades at any time.

The [Course Schedule](../CoursePacing/CoursePacingSum2018A.html) contains all assignments and due dates.


**Computers and Software**

This course will use the RStudio server  (https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/) that has the programs listed below (and more) installed. Note that all technology used in the class is either open source (free) or will be accessible to students enrolled in the course for no cost.

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org) 
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* [LaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/starter)
* DataCamp (via [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/my/))

You must have an active internet connection and be registered in the course to access the server. To access the server, point any web browser to <https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/>.  You will need to acknowledge the connection is unsecure and possibly add a security exception to your web browser. Use your Appstate Username and Password to access the server.  A screen shot of the RStudio server is shown below. If you have problems with your Appstate Username or Password visit [IT Support Services](http://support.appstate.edu/) or call 262-6266.

**Expectations**  

Be proactive in your learning! If you have not read/watched assigned materials and attempted assigned problems before coming to class or office hours, you will likely be confused, feel lost, and have a terrible experience in this course. I DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN! Appalachian students are expected to make intensive engagement with courses their first priority. Practically speaking, this means students should spend about 1-3 hours on course work outside class for every hour they spend in class. If you are not comfortable or have not done well in quantitative courses in the past, you may need to spend more time completing work for this course. I realize that many students work during the school year to finance their educations; however, that does not change the requirements of this (or any) course. Budget your time accordingly and pace yourself so that you can keep up and complete all your work on time. I am here to help you with this material and I want to see you succeed.


**How To Get Unstuck**

Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.


**University Policies**

This course conforms with all Appalachian State University policies with respect to academic integrity, disability services, and class attendance.  The details of the policies may be found at <http://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi>.

As stated in the ASU Undergraduate Bulletin, students are expected to attend all course meetings and are completely responsible for their own attendance. Any student who is absent for any reason is completely responsible for all material covered in class.

Some additional rules for this class:

* No food and drink in class. This is a rule for all computer labs in Walker Hall.
* Be ready to participate when class starts (e.g., notebooks and materials out).
* Do not pack up at the end of class until I am finished teaching and dismiss you.
* Phones must be put away during class. If I see you using your phone, I may ask you to leave.
* Do not check email, surf the web, or do other coursework during class. I may ask you to leave.
* You are not allowed to use tobacco (including dip) or e-cigarettes in class. I _will_ ask you to leave.

Any conduct that disrupts instruction is disrespectful and disruptive both to other students and the instructor. First offenses will be dealt with by the instructor. Subsequent behavior issues will be referred to the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentconduct.appstate.edu/).
