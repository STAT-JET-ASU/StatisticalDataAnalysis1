**Communication**  

I will use the Course Announcements forum on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) to send out announcements and course information. You are responsible for knowing the content of all postings, in addition to anything I say in class. Except for extreme emergencies, all written communication must be handled through your Private Forum on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/). I prefer this method because it stores all exchanges in a place where we can easily access them and it keeps my class communications separate from the rest of my email. Monday through Friday, I will check forums for messages at least once per day between 10am and 6pm. I typically will check at least once on Saturdays. Do not expect replies on Sundays.


**Description**  

STT3850 Statistical Data Analysis 1 provides an overview of modern statistical data analysis. Programming with data, including simulations and bootstrapping, will be an integral part of the course. Techniques for parsing univariate and multivariate data sets will be examined. Coverage of probability, random variables, standard probability distributions and statistical sampling distributions will be sufficient to prepare the student for statistical inference. Inferential topics will include parameter estimation, hypothesis testing for means and proportions, goodness of fit tests, and tests for independence. Standard and computationally intensive regression techniques may also be covered.


**Objectives**

* PROBABILITY: Understand and explain basic theoretical properties of discrete and continuous probability models, such as expected value and variance; solve applied problems using one or more probability models.

* DISTRIBUTIONS: Understand and explain the properties of frequency, shape, center, spread, and outliers in the context of observed data; be able to appropriately summarize and visualize data; be able to calculate, simulate, and summarize sampling distributions for commonly used statistics such as means and proportions.

* STRENGTH OF STATISTICAL EVIDENCE: Understand the logic and construction of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, including the meaning of p-values; be able to perform selected asymptotic, resampling, and bootstrap inference procedures and interpret results in the context of the original problems; be able to discuss and verify the assumptions of modeling and inferential procedures.

* COMPARE AND CONNECT: Compare analytical/theoretical results with resampling/bootstrapping results to connect the different modes of exploration; analyze data sets in different ways depending on the research question(s).

* STATISTICAL COMPUTING: Effectively and efficiently implement and report statistical calculations, procedures, and visualizations using R, incorporating some of the principles of reproducible research.

* STATISTICSâ€”THE BIG PICTURE: Understand why statistical analysis and visualization is important to you, to people in your field of study, to people in other disciplines, and the larger world around us; become acquainted with the ethics of data collection.


**Required Textbooks**

* Chihara, L. and Hesterberg, T. (2011). _Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R, 2nd Edition_. (rental)
* Ismay, C. and Kim, A.Y. (2018). [_Modern Dive: An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R_](https://moderndive.com/index.html). (digital)


**Assessment & Grading**

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes statistical software. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using real data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and assessments have been structured with these principles in mind. It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must "speak the language" (statistics and R) to effectively demonstrate your knowledge. This course uses a standards-based grading methods, which we will discuss further in class.

To earn a course grade of B, you must achieve at least C level in all outcomes, with additional demonstrated achievement halfway to A level. There are two ways to do this: (1) achieve at least 50% (5/10) of the A-level requirements, with the rest at least at the C level; or (2) surpass all 10 of the C level requirements to the halfway point between C and A. To earn a course grade of D you must achieve at least halfway to C level on all outcomes, which _must_ include earning at least 60% on the cumulative final exam. 

Class attendance will be used to assign - or + modifiers to your earned letter grade for the course. To get a + on your final grade, you can miss no more than 6 classes (2 weeks). Missing more than 12 classes (4 weeks) will result in a - on your letter grade.

The [Course Schedule](../Schedule/ScheduleS2019.html) and AsULearn contain additional information. Grades will be kept on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/). You should monitor your grades throughout the term to make sure they are complete and accurate. Feel free to inquire about your grades at any time.

**Expectations**  

Be proactive in your learning! If you have not read/watched assigned materials and attempted assigned problems before coming to class or office hours, you will likely be confused, feel lost, and have a terrible experience in this course. I DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN! Appalachian students are expected to make intensive engagement with courses their first priority. Practically speaking, this means students should spend about 1-3 hours on course work outside class for every hour they spend in class. If you are not comfortable or have not done well in quantitative courses in the past, you may need to spend more time completing work for this course. I realize that many students work during the school year to finance their educations; however, that does not change the requirements of this (or any) course. Budget your time accordingly and pace yourself so that you can keep up and complete all your work on time. I am here to help you with this material and I want to see you succeed.


**Inclement Weather**

All due dates will remain in effect even if the university cancels classes or closes for inclement weather. You should check AsULearn for alternate assignments. Completion of the assignment will serve as your attendance for that class period. Course accommodations for power outages and other weather-related issues will be made as circumstances require, at the discretion of the instructor.


**How To Get Unstuck**

Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.


**University Policies**

This course conforms with all Appalachian State University policies with respect to academic integrity, disability services, and class attendance.  The details of the policies may be found at <http://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi>.

As stated in the ASU Undergraduate Bulletin, students are expected to attend all course meetings and are completely responsible for their own attendance. Any student who is absent for any reason is completely responsible for all material covered in class.

Some additional rules for this class:

* No food and drink in class. This is a rule for all computer labs in Walker Hall.
* Be ready to participate when class starts (e.g., notebooks and materials out).
* Do not pack up at the end of class until I am finished teaching and dismiss you.
* Phones must be put away during class. If I see you using your phone, I may ask you to leave.
* Do not check email, surf the web, or do other coursework during class. I may ask you to leave.
* You are not allowed to use tobacco (including dip) or e-cigarettes in class. I _will_ ask you to leave.

Any conduct that disrupts instruction is disrespectful and disruptive both to other students and the instructor. First offenses will be dealt with by the instructor. Subsequent behavior issues will be referred to the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentconduct.appstate.edu/).
