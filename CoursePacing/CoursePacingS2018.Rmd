Class time in this course will be a mix of lecture and hands-on activities. STT 3850 is an introductory course with no statistics prerequisite and is required for students from several majors, who come into the course with a broad mix of mathematics, statistics, and programming skills. This means that the most effective mode of instruction is a flipped classroom approach where traditional lecture occurs outside the classroom while class time is spent in collaborative work where students can give and receive individualized help from peers and the instructor. Do not treat this instructional style as an invitation to skip class. You classmates are one of your greatest resources.
