## Data vs. Information

Statistical methods help us transform raw data into information that provides knowledge and helps us make decisions.

* We use **descriptive statistics** to summarize datasets or make comparisons between datasets, but we do not go beyond the data we actually have. 

* In **inferential statistics**, sample data are used to generalize or make predictions about the larger population from which the sample was selected.

We will often talk about the **distribution** of a particular variable, which describes how often the possible responses occur.


## Population vs. Sample

A sample is a subset selected from some larger population of interest. The  population is defined by the research question(s) being investigated. It is the complete set of people, objects, or entities in which we are interested.

* A summary measure for a __population__ is called a __parameter__.

* A summary measure for a __sample__ is called a __statistic__.

Sample statistics are used to estimate population parameters.

If we collect data from a whole population, it is called a __census__.

The definining characteristics of theoretical probability models are also called __parameters__.


## Dataset Structure

* A __variable__ is some characteristic of interest that can differ between individuals in a population.

* An __observational unit__ (or __observation__) is a single individual, object, or entity about which we have collected data for one or more characteristics (variables).

* An observation may be called a case, subject, or participant.

* Ideally, each observational unit has a __value__ for each variable.

A __dataset__ is a collection of data values for the observations and variables in a study (e.g., survey or experiment). A common way to arrange data is to put variables in columns and observations in rows. This is what we call `tidy` data. 


## `tidy` Data

Tidy data graphic from http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html</p>

<p>Most of the data we will work with in STT3850 is already in `tidy` format, though there may be missing data and other issues we have to address before conducting analyses.</p>


## Types of Variables

* categorical / qualitative
    + nominal
    + ordinal

* numerical / quantitative
    + interval
    + ratio

Numerical variables are also classified as discrete or continuous.

Ranks are technically ordinal data, but sometimes we treat them as if they are numbers (e.g., reporting average rank).


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is used to "examin[e] and describ[e] data to gain insight, discover structure, and detect anomalies and outliers."

John Tukey (1915--2000), author of _Exploratory Data Analysis_ (1977) referred to EDA as numerical, counting, and graphical detective work.


## Reading Data into R

Many different types of data files can be read into R. We will be using primarily CSV files read from the web using their URL. Our [Class Data Files](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/DatasetList.html) page contains links to many data files provided by the instructor and the textbook.

Using `read.csv()` function to input a CSV dataset from a URL.

`flightDelays <- read.csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Chihara/FlightDelays.csv"))`


`flightDelays <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Chihara/FlightDelays.csv")`

The Flight Delays data is introduced in Ch. 1 of the textbook.

```{r include=FALSE}
flightDelays <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Chihara/FlightDelays.csv")
```


## Data Frame vs. Tibble

The `read.csv()` function converts a CSV file into a __data frame__.

A data frame is a two dimensional structure or array in R. It is a special case of a list where each component (column) has equal length. Each column can contain a different variable type.

A __tibble__ is a slightly tweaked version of a __data frame__. In most cases in STT3850 the two terms may be used interchangeably. For more information, see [Tibbles](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) in _R for Data Science_.

Before doing any kind of data modeling or inference, you need to explore your dataset and become familiar with its structure and contents---that's the first step in EDA!


## Structure vs. Glimpse

The `str()` function is part of base code, `glimpse()` is part of the `tidyverse` package `dplyr`.

```{r, comment=""}
str(flightDelays)
```


##

How does the output of `glimpse()` differ from `str()`?

```{r, message=FALSE, comment=""}
library(dplyr)
glimpse(flightDelays)
```


## Summaries

```{r, comment=""}
summary(flightDelays)
```


## Other Useful Functions

See the [Dataset Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Scripts/master/Dataset-Structure.R?token=ALn2zRXOJWr_OeL4Q8lMeUQSYnE0dVjDks5biDhwwA%3D%3D) script for some other functions you can use to explore and summarize dataset structure, such as:

* `attributes()`
* `dim()`
* `nrow()`
* `ncol()`
* `head()`
* `tail()`
* `sum(complete.cases())`
* `sum(!complete.cases())`
