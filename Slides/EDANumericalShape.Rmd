## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

<p>Tukey also advocated for development of computerized tools to facilitate EDA, so people could focus on *interpreting results*.</p> 


## How We Describe Distributions

**Categorical Variables**

* frequency / relative frequency

*Summaries based on counting how many times categories occur.*

**Quantitative Variables**

* shape
* center
* spread
* outliers

*Shape, center, and spread characterize the pattern of numerical observations. Outliers are deviations from the pattern.*


## Shape

* Visual assessment: how many modes?
    * unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal

* Visual assessment: symmetric or skewed?
    * symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed

* Skewness calculation 
    * numerical quantification of asymmetry

* Kurtosis calculation
    * numerical quantification of peak and tails conformation

We rely heavily on plots to assess the shape of a distribution. A determination of skewness can be difficult with a small sample or more than one mode. Summary measures like skewness and kurtosis should be interpeted _with_ plots.


## Plots for Assessing Shape

* histogram
    * [geom_histogram()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html)
* density plot
    * [geom_density()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density.html)
* empirical cumulative distribution plot
    * [stat_ecdf()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/stat_ecdf.html)
* boxplot
    * [geom_boxplot()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html)
* normal quantile-quantile plot (discussed in other slides) 

See AsULearn Statistics Terms & Concepts glossary and course textbooks for more information on plots and summaries.

    
## Some Data to Plot

Read [gasmileage.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/gasmileage.csv), [oldfaithful.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/oldfaithful.csv), and [Bangladesh.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Chihara/Bangladesh.csv) into RStudio. Remember you need `library(tidyverse)` for many of the functions we will use, including `read_csv()`. In coming slides they will be referred to by the following names.

* mileage: results of 100 EPA gas mileage tests for a particular model of car, in miles per gallon (mpg)

* geyser: eruption data for Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, including duration in minutes and number of minutes until the next eruption.

* wells: concentration of three contaminants for a sample of wells in Bangladesh, in parts per million (ppm) 


##

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mileage <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/gasmileage.csv")
geyser  <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/oldfaithful.csv")
wells   <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Chihara/Bangladesh.csv")
```

```{r}
glimpse(geyser)
glimpse(wells)
```

You should also `glimpse()` the `mileage` dataset, which has only one variable: `mpg`.


## Basic Histogram

```{r, fig.height = 4.0}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_histogram()
```


## &nbsp;

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(geyser, aes(x = erupt_time)) + geom_histogram()
```


## &nbsp;

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(wells, aes(x = Arsenic)) + geom_histogram()
```


## Rules of Thumb for Number of Bins

* between 5 and 15 bins
* between 5 and 20 bins
* number of bins near the square root of the sample size n
* Sturge’s rule, number of bins around 1 + 3.322 × log(n)
* Freedman-Diaconis rule, about 2 × IQR × n^(−1/3) bins

Finding the right binwidth is an interative process. in `R` you can set an approximate number of bins, choose a specific bin width, or specify exact boundaries you want for the bins.

The default number of bins in `geom_histogram()` is 30.

## Basic Density

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_density()
```


## &nbsp;

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(geyser, aes(x = erupt_time)) + geom_density()
```


## &nbsp;

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(wells, aes(x = Arsenic)) + geom_density()
```


## Density Over Histogram

```{r, fig.height = 3.7}
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_density()
```


## &nbsp;

```{r, fig.height = 3.7}
ggplot(geyser, aes(x = erupt_time)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_density()
```


## &nbsp;

```{r, fig.height = 3.7}
ggplot(wells, aes(x = Arsenic)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_density()
```


## Add Some Color

```{r, fig.height = 3.7}
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 10, color = "black") + 
  geom_density(fill = "lightblue", color = "blue", alpha = 0.50)
```


## Empirical Cumulative Distribution

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + stat_ecdf()
```


## Density and ECDF

The vertical line shows the 50th percentile---the halfway point.

```{r, fig.height = 2.9}
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + 
  geom_density(color = "lightblue", fill = "lightblue") + 
  stat_ecdf(color = "blue") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(mileage$mpg, .5))
```


## More About Plots and Shape

You will learn more about assessing distribution shape in later slides, including quantitative measures skewness and kurtosis, boxplots, and quantile-quantile plots.

Many modeling and statistical inference procedures have as an assumption that one or more variables is *approximately normal* in distribution. Determining whether this assumption is valid in a specific analysis is often necessary.

We can add labels and other customizations to these plots the same way we did when making barplots. 

Practice your plotting skills on other datasets! For example, try the datasets found in Chapter 1 of MSRR.
