<p>"...the object of statistical methods is the reduction of data. A quantity of data, which usually by its mere bulk is incapable of entering the mind, is to be replaced by relatively few quantities which shall adequately represent the whole, or...shall contain as much as possible, ideally the whole, of the relevant information contained in the original data." ~ R.A. Fisher, 1921</p>


## How We Describe Distributions

**Categorical Variables**

* frequency / relative frequency

*Summaries based on counting how many times categories occur.*

**Quantitative Variables**

* shape
* center
* spread
* outliers

*Shape, center, and spread characterize the pattern of numerical observations. Outliers are deviations from the pattern.*


## Exploring Categorical Data

* frequency table
* relative frequency table
* cumulative frequency table
* cumulative relative frequency table
* contingency table
* [bar chart / barplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html)
* ~~pie chart~~

“There is no data that can be displayed in a pie chart that cannot be displayed better in some other type of chart.” (some attribute this quote to John Tukey, and while that fact cannot be verified, it is generally a true statement)


## Frequency Tables

In the early 1970s, UC Berkeley was concerned about possible sex discrimination in grad school admissions. The [berkeley.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/berkeley.csv) dataset contains fall 1973 data for the six largest departments.

```{r echo=FALSE}
berkdata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/berkeley.csv")
```

```{r}
summary(berkdata)
```

For space, I hid the `read.csv()` code used to import the data and name it `berkdata` using echo=FALSE in the R code chunk.


## Using `table()` and `prop.table()`

```{r}
table(berkdata$sex)
prop.table(table(berkdata$sex))
```

What class of object do `table()` and `prop.table()` produce?


## A `table()` Stored as an Object

```{r}
statusTab <- table(berkdata$status)
prop.table(statusTab)
round(prop.table(statusTab), 4)
```

What is the result if you use `as.data.frame()` on statusTab?

Why might you want to convert your summary's object type?


## Contingency (Two-Way) Tables

```{r}
sexbystatusTab <- table(berkdata$sex, berkdata$status)
print(sexbystatusTab)
addmargins(sexbystatusTab)
```


## Contingency Table as `tidy` Data

```{r}
as.data.frame(sexbystatusTab)
```

This verion of a summary table would be easier to plot with a package like `ggplot2`. Consider the purpose of the summary. Will it be the input for another process?


## Row Proportions

Proportions are calculated by treating each row as a separate frequency table. The rows (not columns) sum to one or 100%.

```{r}
prop.table(sexbystatusTab, 1)
rowSums(prop.table(sexbystatusTab, 1))
```


## Column Proportions

Proportions are calculated by treating each column as a table. The columns (not rows) sum to one or 100%.

```{r}
prop.table(sexbystatusTab, 2)
colSums(prop.table(sexbystatusTab, 2))
```


## Using `dplyr` to Make "Tables"

The `table()` function produces a named vector or matrix. The method using the `dplyr` package produces a `tibble`.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
berkdata %>% count(sex)
```

Some functions such as `chisq.test()` expect vector or matrix input. Again, consider the reason for making the table.


## Cumulative Frequency Tables 

```{r}
berkdata %>% 
  count(department) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(prop      = prop.table(n),
         cum_count = cumsum(n),
         cum_prop  = cumsum(prop))
```


## Using `dplyr` for Contingency Tables

When we use `dplyr` to summarize two variables, we still get all combinations with non-zero counts, but arranged in a `tibble`. 

```{r}
berkdata %>% 
  count(sex, status)
```

If a combination has no cases (n = 0), it will not be included in the `tibble`, which may be a problem.


## Rearranging the "Table"

The `tidyr` package has functions like `gather()` and `spread()` to help manipulate `tibble` arrangement.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
berkdata %>% 
  count(sex, status) %>% 
  spread(status, n)
```

This format could help with data visualization, but is it `tidy`?


## What is "grammar of graphics"?

* R's `ggplot2` is a system for creating graphics, based on the concepts introduced in the book [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1477928463&sr=8-1&keywords=the+grammar+of+graphics&linkCode=sl1&tag=ggplot2-20&linkId=f0130e557161b83fbe97ba0e9175c431) (2005) --- metastructure and connected visualizations

* `aesthetics` (like x, y, color, size, fill) code data or variables from a dataset onto the plot (*what* you want to plot)

* graphical elements displayed in a plot (like points, lines, or bars) are `geometries` (*how* you want to plot)

* you can include multiple geometries on your plot, using the same or different `aesthetics` for each

* facets allow us to visualize the same graphical elements for important groups or subsets of data 


## Barplots using `ggplot2`

```{r fig.height=3.7}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex)) + 
  geom_bar()
```


## Proportions Instead of Counts

```{r fig.height=3.7}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y=..count../sum(..count..))) + labs(y = "proportion")
```


## Improve the Presentation

```{r fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue", color = "gray") +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad Applicants F73", x = "applicant sex")
```


## Barplots for Two Variables

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) + 
  geom_bar()
```


## Bars Side-by-Side vs. Stacked

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```


## Proportions vs. Counts

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + labs(y = "proportion")
```


## Barplots from Summarized Data

We can still make a barplot if we have summarized vs. raw data.

```{r fig.height=3}
dept_tab <- berkdata %>% count(department)
ggplot(dept_tab, aes(x = department, y = n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + labs(y = "count")
```


## Barplots Without a Data Frame

We also can create a barplot from vectors not in a data frame.

```{r fig.height=3}
department <- factor(c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"))
n <- c(933, 585, 918, 792, 584, 714)
ggplot(NULL, aes(x = department, y = n)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```


## More About Color

The online _Cookbook for R_ shows some [color options](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/) and built-in color palettes for plots. You can use colors by name (if it has one that R recognizes, use `colors()` function to see a list), hex code, or rgb value (e.g., [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/) or [ColorHexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/)).

* _color_ typically refers to points, lines, outlines
* _fill_ typically refers to some internal shading

```{r plotcolor1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar(color = "darkgray") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("palegreen", "turquoise")) +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad Applicants, Fall 1973",
       subtitle = "Six Largest Department Applicant Pools",
       caption = "source dataset = berkeley.csv",
       x = "sex of applicant", y = "number of applicants")
```


## The Faceted Plot

```{r plotcolor1a, ref.label='plotcolor1', echo=FALSE}

```


## Three Variables? Use Faceting

Faceting creates multiple "panes" in a plot according to some chosen grouping variable. Use `facet_grid()` or `facet_wrap()` to achieve different configurations.

```{r plotcolor2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar(color = "darkgray") +
  facet_grid(. ~ department) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("palegreen", "turquoise")) +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad Applicants, Fall 1973",
       subtitle = "Data from Six Largest Department Applicant Pools",
       caption = "source dataset = berkeley.csv",
       x = "sex of applicant",
       y = "number of applicants")
```


## &nbsp;

Here the six plots are configured into a 1 x 6 facet grid. What happens if you use `facet_grid(department ~ .)` instead?

```{r plotcolor2a, ref.label='plotcolor2', echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}

```


## Use `facet.wrap()` vs. `facet.grid()`

Plots wrapped into rows using `facet_wrap(~ department)`. The wrap tries to optimize for a rectangular arrangement.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar(color = "darkgray") +
  facet_wrap(~ department) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("palegreen", "turquoise")) +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad Applicants in Fall 73",
       subtitle = "Data from Six Largest Department Applicant Pools",
       caption = "source dataset = berkeley.csv",
       x = "sex of applicant",
       y = "number of applicants")
```


## Conclusions

* Do the overall rejection rates for male and female applicants suggest bias in admissions?

* What does faceting the data by department show with regard to rejection of applicants?

* Are there any other summaries / plots you would like to see? Can you create them?

* Do you prefer tables or barplots for exploring the data? Why?

The Berkeley bias dataset is an example of Simpson's Paradox.
