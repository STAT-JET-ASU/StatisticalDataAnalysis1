# Bernoulli Trials

## What is a Bernoulli Trial?

A Bernoulli trial is a single random event that has two possible outcomes, often called "success" and "failure". 

Success is not necessarily a good outcome, but it is the outcome of interest for a given problem or scenario.

Classic examples include a coin flip where a head is considered success and a tail is considered failure, or one roll of a standard 6-sided die where 1 is success and any other number is failure.

The Bernoulli model has a single parameter.

* _p_ = probability of success  
* _q_ = probability of failure = 1 - _p_  
* _p_ + _q_ = 1  


## Bernoulli Trial as Building Block

Other probability distributions (e.g., binomial, geometric) model the outcomes of sequences of Bernoulli trials; for example, the number of heads seen in 100 coin flips, or how many times we have to roll a 6-sided die to observe our first 1.

A necessary condition for binomial and geometric distributions is that all of the trials are independent with constant chance of success _p_ on each trial.

Bernoulli trials are named for the Swiss mathematician [Jacob Bernoulli](http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Bernoulli_Jacob.html) (1654-1705), who made important advancements in probability theory, including an early version of the law of large numbers. Many appeared in his posthumously-published book [_Ars Conjectandi_](https://books.google.com/books?id=XPOf7STJ3y4C&pg=PP5#v=onepage&q&f=false) (_The Art of Conjecturing_).


# Binomial Distribution

## The Binomial Model

The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution. It models the number of successes in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. 

$$X \sim Bin(n,p)$$

_x_ = number of successes = {0, 1, 2, ..., n}
    
_n_ = number of trials
    
_p_ = probability of success on a single trial
    
1 - _p_ = probability of failure on a single trial


## Probability Mass Function (pmf)

The probability of a given number of successes x in a Bernoulli model is found using the probability mass function (pmf).

$$P(X = x) = f(x) = {n \choose x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} = $$

$$\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$

R has a function to solve the pmf for any given binomial model. Inputs may be single values or vectors.

<center>$P(X = x)$ = $f(x)$ = `dbinom(x, n, p)`</center>


## Cumulative Distribution Function (pmf)

The probability of a given number of successes _or fewer_ is found using the CDF.

$$F(x)=P(X \leq x) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^x {n \choose i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}$$

The expected (mean) number of successes and the variance of the number of successes are found as follows.

$$E[X] = np$$

$$Var[X] = np(1-p)$$

$$SD[X] = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$$


## R Functions for Binomial Modeling

pmf



CDF

$P(X \leq x)$ = $F(x,n,p)$ = `pbinom(x, n, p)`

$P(X > x)$ = $1-F(x,n,p)$ = use `lower.tail = FALSE`

$q^{th}$ percentile (approx) = $F^{-1}(x,n,p)$ = `qbinom(q, n, p)` 

There are no default values for n and p in R. These parameters must always be specified.

To generate `s` random binomial values, `rbinom (s, n, p)`




## Zener Card Tests

[Parapsychology](http://www.psychicscience.org/parintro.aspx) is the study of paranormal/psychic phenomena.

<p style="text-align: center;">![](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Moodlepics/zenercards.jpg)</p>

Zener cards, shown above, were developed by Karl Zener in the 1930s for parapsychological testing. They were featured in the movie _Ghostbusters_, used by Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), a PhD in psychology and parapsychology. Take a [Zener card test](https://www.psychic-experiences.com/psychic-tests/zener-cards.php)!


## Modeling the Zener Card Test

Assuming we conduct an open deck test as described... 

* What are the parameters of the binomial model?
* What is the expected number of correct guesses?
* What is the probability of getting _exactly_ that number?
* What is the variance / SD in the number of correct guesses?
* What is the probability of getting 10 or more cards correct?
* What is the probability of getting more than 10 cards correct?
* What are the probabilities associated with your test results?
* What is the chance of exceeding 10 correct on multiple tests?
* What if our test used a total of 100 trials rather than 25?
* Can we simulate the outcome of one or more tests?


# Geometric Distribution

## Probability Mass Function (pmf)

The geometric distribution is a discrete probability distribution. It models the number of trials required to get the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.

$$X \sim Geo(p)$$

    x = number of trials = {1, 2, 3, ... }
    p = probability of success on a single trial
    q = 1 - p

$$P(X=x)=p(1-p)^{x-1}=pq^{x-1}$$

There is more than one way to mathematically define Geo(p). We can let X be the number of trials before the first success. This would change the pmf, CDF, etc.


## Cumulative Distribution Function (pmf)

The CDF is:

$$P(X \leq x)=1-(1-p)^x$$

The expected value and variance are:

$$E[X] = \frac{1}{p}$$

$$Var[X] = \frac{(1-p)}{p^2} = \frac{q}{p^2}$$

Mathematically, the geometric distribution is an analogue of the (continuous) exponential distribution. It is also the only discrete distribution that has the _memoryless property_.


## R Functions for Geometric Modeling

If `x` is the number of trials required to get the first success...

`dgeom(x - 1, p)` = $f(x-1,p)$ = $P(X = x)$

`pgeom(x - 1, p)` = $F(x-1,p)$ =  $P(X \leq x)$

`pgeom(x - 1, p, lower.tail = FALSE)` = $P(X > x)$

`qgeom(q, p)` = $q^{th}$ percentile

`rgeom(s, p)` generates `s` random variates


## Modeling the Zener Card Test

Assuming that we conduct an open deck test as described... 

* How many guesses should you expect to need get a success?
* What is the variance / SD of the number of guesses required? 
* What is the probability that your very first guess is a success?
* How long _could_ it take you to get your first success? What are the chances that it takes you two, three, five, or ten guesses?
* Suppose your first four guesses in a row are incorrect. What is the chance your next guess is correct? 
* Can we find probabilities using simulation?
