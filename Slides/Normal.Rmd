## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

# Exploration #1:<br>The Normal Model

## Notation and Parameters

The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution. Very few concepts in real life are truly normally distributed, but many are _approximately_ normal. The normal is also the limiting distribution for many common statistics and other distributions when sample size n $\rightarrow \infty$.

$$X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$$

_x_ = {-$\infty$ to +$\infty$} = the sample space
    
$\mu$ = the mean (or expected value) of the distribution
    
$\sigma^2$ = the variance of the distribution

The standard normal distribution $Z$ has $\mu$ = 0 and $\sigma^2$ = $\sigma$ = 1.


## Probability Density Function (pdf)

Unlike the pmfs in discrete distributions, the probability density function (pdf) of a continuous distribution does not compute a probability, because the area under a point is zero. Instead a pdf gives the height of the function (y) at x.

$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}$$

R has a function to solve the pmf for any given normal model. Inputs may be single values or vectors.

<center>$f(x)$ = `dnorm(x, mean, sd)`</center><br>

Note that the `R` function uses standard deviation as an input, rather than the distribution variance.

# Integration #1

## 

1) Standard IQ tests, such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), are typically scaled so that scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Plot the pdf of WAIS scores.

2) Scores on some older versions of the Stanford-Binet IQ test are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 16. Plot the pdf.

3) Cattell Culture Fair Test scores are normally distributed with mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 24. Plot the pdf.

4) Subscales of the current Stanford-Binet have scores that are normally distributed with $\mu$ = 10 and $\sigma$ = 3. Plot the pdf.

5) The heights of US adult women are normally distributed with $\mu$ = 5' 2.5" and $\sigma$ = 3". Plot four pdfs with heights expressed in (a) inches; (b) feet; (c) centimeters; and (d) meters.


# Exploration #2:<br>Probabilities

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The probability of the variable X having given value x *or less* is found using the CDF, which integrates the area under the curve. This is similar to a discrete distribution. The normal distribution has no closed-form solution for $F(x)$. `R` has a function for the normal CDF (and its inverse, which we will discuss later).

$$F(x)=P(X \leq x) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}dx$$

$P(X \leq x)$ = `pnorm(q, mean, sd, lower.tail = TRUE)`

$P(X > x)$ = `pnorm(q, mean, sd, lower.tail = FALSE)`


## Expected Value and Variance

The theoretical expected value and variance for any distribution are generally found as follows. We cannot integrate $f(x)$, but it can be demonstrated that expected value and variance simplify to the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ for the normal distribution.

$$E[X] = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x f(x) \rightarrow \mu$$

$$Var[X] = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} (x - \mu)^2 f(x) \rightarrow \sigma^2$$

## The Empirical Rule

The normal distribution is unimodal and perfectly symmetric.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Moodlepics/normaldist.jpg"></p>

* approximately 68% of the curve area is between $\mu \pm 1\sigma$ 
* approximately 95% of the curve area is between $\mu \pm 2\sigma$ 
* approximately 99.7% of the curve area is between $\mu \pm 3\sigma$ 


# Integration #2

##

1) Use `pnorm()` and $N(0,1)$ to calculate how much area is to the *left* of the points $\mu - 3\sigma$, $\mu - 2\sigma$, $\mu - 1\sigma$, $\mu$, $\mu + 1\sigma$, $\mu + 2\sigma$, and $\mu + 3\sigma$

2) Use `pnorm()` and $N(0,1)$ to calculate how much area is to the *right* of the points $\mu - 3\sigma$, $\mu - 2\sigma$, $\mu - 1\sigma$, $\mu$, $\mu + 1\sigma$, $\mu + 2\sigma$, and $\mu + 3\sigma$

3) The Empirical Rule tells us the approximate areas under the curve between $\mu \pm 1\sigma$, $\mu \pm 2\sigma$, and $\mu \pm 3\sigma$. Use `pnorm()` and $N(0,1)$ to calculate the exact area in these regions.

4) Verify that the areas between $\mu \pm 1\sigma$, $\mu \pm 2\sigma$, and $\mu \pm 3\sigma$ are the same for the distribution of WAIS scores as they are for $N(0,1)$ using `qnorm()`.

# Exploration #3:<br>Quantiles

## Inverse CDF

In the discussions above, we found the area to the left of a given point (or *quantile*) on the x-axis. Sometimes we need to solve the reverse kind of problem: given an area or probability, what is the corresponding quantile or quantiles?

$F^{-1}(x)$ = `qnorm(p, mean, sd, lower.tail = TRUE)` 

If the area is to the right of the unknown value x (the upper tail) rather than to the left (the lower tail), specify upper tail.

$F^{-1}(x)$ = `qnorm(p, mean, sd, lower.tail = FALSE)`

If we know $\mu$, $\sigma$, and either the value(s) of x or the area(s)...

`pnorm(q, mean, sd) = p` $\Longleftrightarrow$ `qnorm(p, mean, sd) = q`

# Integration #3

1) Use `qnorm()` to find the first quartile (Q~1~), median, and third quartile (Q~3~) of $N(0,1)$.

2) The deciles of a distribution are percentiles that are multiples of 10 (10th percentile, 20th percentile, up to 90th percentile). Find the deciles of adult male and female heights.

3) To be a member of the high-IQ society Mensa, a person must score in the top 2% on a standard test of intelligence. What scores would be required on the WAIS and Catell tests? What is the equivalent score on $Z$? Use `qnorm()` to solve.

4) The Empirical Rule tells us that the areas under the curve between $\mu \pm 1\sigma$, $\mu \pm 2\sigma$, and $\mu \pm 3\sigma$ are ~68%, ~95%, and ~99%. Use `qnorm()` and $N(0,1)$ to calculate the more exact boundaries of the middle 68%, 95%, and 99%.

# Exploration #5:<br>Sampling and Simulating

## Sampling from a Normal Distribution

In addition to calculating probabilities, we can simulate random normal values in `R` using `rnorm (n, mean, sd)`.

_n_ = the number of random values (sample size)

_mean_ = the mean of the distribution
    
_sd_ = the standard deviation of the distribution

As with the other *norm* functions, the default parameter settings in `rnorm()` are `mean = 0` and `sd = 1`. If we want a sample from the standard normal distribution, we only need to enter a value for sample size, `rnorm(n)`.

# Integration #5:<br>Simulating Data

## 

1) Generate samples of different sizes from a standard normal distribution.

2) Generate samples of different sizes from the various IQ tests we discussed.

3) Use your EDA skills to explore and plot the various samples. Do the distributions look bell-shaped? Do they have close to what you would expected for mean and standard deviation? Are there any outliers? 

4) How does sample size impact your results? Where do you see more variability from sample to sample?
