## What is EDA?

"If we need a short suggestion of what exploratory data analysis is, I would suggest that

* It is an attitude AND

* A flexibility AND

* Some graph paper (or transparencies, or both).""

<p style = "text-align: right;">~ John Tukey, 1980</p>

<hr>

<p>Tukey also advocated for development of computerized tools to facilitate EDA, so people could focus on interpreting results.</p> 


## How We Describe Distributions

**Categorical Variables**

* frequency / relative frequency

*Summaries based on counting how many times categories occur.*

**Quantitative Variables**

* shape
* center
* spread
* outliers

*Shape, center, and spread characterize the pattern of numerical observations. Outliers are deviations from the pattern.*


## Shape

* how many modes?
    * unimodal
    * bimodal
    * multimodal
* symmetric or skewed?
    * right skewed
    * left skewed
* skewness (quantification of asymmetry)
* kurtosis (conformation of peak and tails)

We rely heavily on plots to assess shape. Summary measures like skewness and kurtosis should be interpeted _with_ plots.


## Plots for Assessing Shape

* histogram
    * [geom_histogram()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html)
* density plot
    * [geom_density()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density.html)
* empirical cumulative distribution plot
    * [stat_ecdf()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/stat_ecdf.html)
* boxplot
    * [geom_boxplot()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html)

See AsULearn Statistics Terms & Concepts glossary and course textbooks for more information on plots and summaries.

    
## Some Data to Plot

Load [gasmileage.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/gasmileage.csv) and [oldfaithful.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/oldfaithful.csv) into RStudio. Let's plot! 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mileage <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/gasmileage.csv")
geyser  <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/oldfaithful.csv")
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
glimpse(mileage)
glimpse(geyser)
```


## Basic Histogram

```{r, fig.height = 4.0}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_histogram()
```


## &nbsp;

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(geyser, aes(x = wait_time)) + geom_histogram()
```


## Rules of Thumb for Number of Bins

* between 5 and 15 bins
* between 5 and 20 bins
* number of bins near the square root of the sample size n
* Sturge’s rule, number of bins around 1 + 3.322 × log(n)
* Freedman-Diaconis rule, about 2 × IQR × n^(−1/3) bins

Finding the right binwidth is an interative process. You can set an approximate number of bins, a specific bin width, or exact boundaries you want for the bins.

The default number of bins is 30.

## Basic Density

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_density()
```


## &nbsp;

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(geyser, aes(x = wait_time)) + geom_density()
```


## Density Over Histogram

```{r, fig.height = 3.7}
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) + 
  geom_density()
```


## &nbsp;

```{r, fig.height = 3.7}
ggplot(geyser, aes(x = wait_time)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) + 
  geom_density()
```


## Empirical Cumulative Distribution

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + stat_ecdf()
```


## Density and ECDF

```{r, fig.height = 3.7}
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = mpg)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  stat_ecdf()
```


## Skewness and Kurtosis

```{r}
library(moments)
skewness(mileage$mpg)
kurtosis(mileage$mpg)
kurtosis(mileage$mpg) - 3
```

We will discuss more about connections between measures in upcoming slides.


## Center

* mean
    * arithmetic mean ("average", _expected value_)
    * geometric mean
    * weighted mean
    * trimmed mean
* median
* mode (we use this more with reference to shape)

Mean and median are both the "middle" of a given distribution, but the two summaries define middle or _center_ differently.


## Spread

* variance
    * population
    * sample
* standard deviation
* mean absolute deviation (mad)
* median absolute deviation (_also_ mad?)
* interquartile range (IQR)
* range

Summarizing the deviations of a set of values from some center point is a common technique in statistics. 


## Measures Based on Moments

In physics, a moment of force is the turning effect of the force about a central point, as a function of distance from the point. Statistical moments are a similar idea.

mean (first moment)

* the mean $\mu$ is the value that makes $\Sigma(X - \mu)^1 = 0$ true
* mean is the center of mass or _balance point_ of a distribution

variance (second moment)

$$M_2 = \frac{\Sigma(X - \mu)^2}{n} = \sigma^2$$ 

$$\text{standard deviation} = \sigma $$


## &nbsp;

skewness (third moment)

$$M_3 = \frac{\Sigma(X - \mu)^3}{n}$$

$$skewness = \frac{\Sigma(X - \mu)^3}{\sigma^3}$$

kurtosis (fourth moment)

$$M_4 = \frac{\Sigma(X - \mu)^4}{n}$$

$$kurtosis = \frac{\Sigma(X - \mu)^4}{\sigma^4}$$


## Moment-Based Summaries in R

* `mean()`
* `var()`
* `sd()`
* `skewness()`
* `kurtosis()`
* `mad()` (not a moment, but a related concept)

As seen on an earlier slide, `skewness` and `kurtosis` come from the `moments` package. For each function, you should explore the syntax, parameters, and output.


## Measures Based on Ordered Counts

* five-number-summary
    * minimum
    * first quartile (Q<sub>1</sub>)
    * median
    * third quartile (Q<sub>3</sub>)
    * maximum
* interquartile range (IQR)
* range
* percentiles / quantiles


## Count-Based Summaries in R

* `fivenum()`
* `min()`
* `median()`
* `max()`
* `IQR()`
* `range()`
* `quantile()`

Again, you should explore the syntax, parameters, and output of each function to understand how it works.


## Summarizing Using `dplyr`

TBA! 


## Boxplots and Outliers

One of the most common rules for determining outliers is based on the five-number summary. We can visualize the five-number summary and outliers in a boxplot.

## Calculating the Fences

```{r}
lowerFence <- fivenum(mileage$mpg)[2] - 1.5 * IQR(mileage$mpg)
print(lowerFence)
upperFence <- fivenum(mileage$mpg)[4] + 1.5 * IQR(mileage$mpg)
print(upperFence)
boxplot.stats(sort(mileage$mpg))[4]
```


## Calculating the Fences in `dplyr`

TBA!


## Boxplot for One Variable

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(mileage, aes(x = 1, y = mpg)) + geom_boxplot()
```


## Comparing Groups

Load the [FlightDelays.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Chihara/FlightDelays.csv) dataset into RStudio. Let's compare!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
flt_del <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Chihara/FlightDelays.csv")
```

```{r}
glimpse(flt_del)
```


## Comparative Boxplots

```{r, fig.height = 4.3}
ggplot(flt_del, aes(x = Carrier, y = FlightLength)) + geom_boxplot()
```


## Comparative Boxplots Plus

Consider some of the options you learned when working with barplots in the Categorical Data slides or in DataCamp courses. They apply here as well.

```{r boxplot_enhanced, eval = FALSE}
flt_del$Month <- factor(flt_del$Month, levels = c("May", "June"))

ggplot(flt_del, aes(x = Carrier, y = FlightLength, fill = Carrier)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ Month) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("American", "United")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("lightgreen","lightblue")) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(title = "Length of AA and UA Flights from LGA in 2013",
       y = "Length of Flight (minutes)",
       caption = "Source: Chihara & Hesterberg, FlightDelays")
```


## The Result!

```{r ref.label = 'boxplot_enhanced', echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5.0}

```
