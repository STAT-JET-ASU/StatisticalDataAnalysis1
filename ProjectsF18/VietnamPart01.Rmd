### The Process

In December 1969, the U.S. Selective Service System conducted a lottery to a determine draft order for eligible men in the upcoming year. The 366 days of the year (including February 29) were written on small pieces of paper. Each was placed in a plastic capsule, then the capsules were hand-mixed in a shoebox and dumped in a glass jar. Capsules were pulled out one at a time. The first number chosen was 258 (September 14). Anyone born on that day in 1944 through 1950 was assigned lottery number 1. The first 195 birthdates drawn were later called to serve in the order they were drawn. Some people asserted that the numbers were not randomly distributed through the year, in particular when you compared the first half of the year to the second half of the year.

### The Problem

The draft numbers for 1970 were drawn without replacement from the set $x = \{1, 2, 3, ..., 366\}$. The probability of drawing any draft number remaining in the pool at each step of the process was believed to be equal for all numbers, which would mean that all possible permutations of the 366 integers were equally likely---a fair process. It is impossible to prove whether the selection process was biased (non-random), but we can assess whether the outcome seems to be consistent with randomness. For this part of the project, you will use exploratory data analysis.


### Your Analyses

1) Create a boxplot to show the overall distribution of draft numbers. Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and five-number summary and display results in a tibble.

2) Create boxplots to compare the distributions of draft numbers by month (in order). Include a horizontal line to represent the overall mean draft number for 1970. 

3) Create boxplots and density plots to compare the distributions of draft numbers by half-year. Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and five-number summary for both groups and display in a tibble.

4) In your opinion, what are two aspects of the physical process used to select the numbers in the 1970 draft lottery could cast doubt on the fairness of the results? How could they have impacted the randomness?

5) What information from your distribution analyses of the 1970 draft numbers could be used as evidence to cast doubt on the fairness of the results? Would the results be impossible in a fair lottery system?
