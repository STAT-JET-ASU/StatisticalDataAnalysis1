### The Process

A [digital communication channel transmits binary signals](http://what-when-how.com/data-communications-and-networking/digital-transmission-of-digital-data/) (0 or 1). Suppose a particular system is susceptible to electronic interference, so there is a 1% chance that any bit sent by the system will be incorrectly received (i.e., a sent 0 is mistakenly interpreted as 1). Assume that the interference is non-patterned, so all bit transmission errors are random and independent. One simple method for error reduction is repetition code. For critical messages, we can use triple repetition code (TRC). The individual digits are transmitted as repeated blocks of three identical digits (a single 0 in the message would be sent as the block 000 and a single 1 would be sent as 111). The receiver uses a "majority logic decoding" method on blocks. If the majority of the three-block's digits are interpreted by the receiver as 0, then the transmitted digit represented by the block is recorded as a single 0. If the majority are interpreted as 1, then the transmitted digit is recorded as a 1.


### The Problem

How can we model this system? What are its performance characteristics? How many errors can we expect if we transmit them using this system? Can we modify the system for better performance?


### Your Analyses

1) We could improve the performance of the system by insulating the equipment better to reduce the initial 1% chance of error. Create a plot that shows x = chance of error from 0% to 1% (in 0.01% increments) versus y = chance that a TRC block is interpreted correctly at that error rate. What rate would allow us to achieve greater than 99.99% chance of correct block interpretation?
