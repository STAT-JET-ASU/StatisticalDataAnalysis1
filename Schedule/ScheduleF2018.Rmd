Class time in this course will be a mix of lecture and hands-on activities. STT 3850 is an introductory course with no statistics prerequisite and is required for students from several majors. Students come into the course with a broad mix of mathematics, statistics, and programming skills. This means that the most effective mode of instruction tends to be a semi-flipped classroom approach where some lecture occurs outside the classroom in the form of videos. This frees up class time to spend on collaborative work where students can give and receive individual help from peers and the instructor. Do not treat this instructional mode as an invitation to skip class! Your classmates are one of your greatest resources.
